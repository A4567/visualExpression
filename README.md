Session 1 of Generative Systems for Art and Design, 

Task: Create a set of rules to follow while drawing, follow these rules while drawing by hand, refine the rules, have other people follow the rules, translate the rules to code

My Rules: 
       - Starting anywhere on the page draw a polygon
       - The next shape you draw cannot be nested in the last one but may overlap
       - The next shape must be different to the last one
       - The next shape must be bigger than the last
       - Drawing can only stop when the number of shapes drawn is a factor of the total sides - with a minimum requirement of 6 shapes
       - Shapes cannot be modified or erased once drawn to end the drawing
       
This repo contains my translation of these rules into code
